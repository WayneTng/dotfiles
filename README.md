dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for vim, tmux and everything else.

Locally, I store all my dotfiles in `~/.dotfiles` and then symlink the relevant files. eg. I symlink ~/.vimrc to ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc.

My motivation for doing this is to separate out my own changing dotfiles from my home directory.

In this way, I have also simplified my .gitignore file (previously I have to specify all kinds of folders and files that I do not want to commit)

To be used at your own risk!
